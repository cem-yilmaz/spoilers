# R3
*To test this, YouTube's "trending" page was loaded (with no logged in account and wiped history) and a mouse scroll macro was ran to load as many videos as possible. This test was ran with and without the extension active. When active, the extension censored all videos **but still calculated the filtering. This "flag" was turned on at the lowest level to skip as little calculation as possible.***
## Results (ms) without extension active
9266  
9739

avg = **9509**
## Results (ms) with extension active
9727  
9487

avg = **9767**

## Final conclusion
This is a *~+2.71%* increase.
