We can see that R1 has been satisfied by the code. All tests pass.
R2 is unfortunately not fully passing, and it is a deficit of our testing suite that the amount of combinations passed is not noted. Future iterations would hopefully have a method of logging the percentage of combinations passed, but I was regrettably unable to add this functionality in my limited development time.

R3 has also passed; one of the requirements was to not add 50% load to the *YouTube* page load-time which we have absolutely achieved with our ~3% increase. Further testing could have been included to support this, but development time regrettably ran out.
