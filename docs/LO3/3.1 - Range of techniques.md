We are using a wide range of techniques in this test suite. Functional testing is most widely used (mostly in the standard database CRUD operations), but sometimes takes the form of combinatorial testing (namely for the extension's query formulation). We are also employing statistical testing to stress test the database and also to ensure our software loads faster than the spoilers it intends to block can appear.
