# System
The CRUD requirements (with validity checking) are prime examples of system-level tests
# Integration
- All of the requirements between the 
- The "cascade delete" functionality sends requests to specific elements of the system based on their relations to the origin. 
- Requirements on how data is stored and read from the database
# Unit
Each function we can perform based on a single entry (media/spoiler/url) is a unit level requirement. For example,
- getting the information from a media entry to populate the tracked media list
- getting all spoilers from a big filter to get a new list of URLs
- seeing if a specific video will be blocked successfully
# Performance
We want the extension to be light on server performance to accommodate the vast amounts of data that will be stored in it. There are requirements that ensure the server is not overly-queried.
The extension takes on much of the work but also needs to be performant enough to "get everything ready" fast enough before the YouTube page can load. This is a *relative speed* requirement, and thus can be compared to regular YouTube loading speed.
# Safety
- There are a some requirements focusing on sanitising data to the database to avoid SQL injection or other similar attacks
- We also rate limit requests to the database
