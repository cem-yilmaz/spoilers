# Shortcomings
- A possible security issue could be through how the software ensures the video ID is "valid". A more comprehensive test - one that actually checks the content on the page `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[video id]` (to see if it returns a private or unavailable video, for example) would be susceptible to injection attacks that redirect to malicious sites. We will instead need to go for a more coarse grained solution (e.g one that uses regex) or a slower/heavier/costly one using YouTube's API.
- The statistical performance testing may not cover all patterns of user behaviour. In the future, the database might have dynamically allocated resources based on load; it would be useful to have tests for this but they would unfortunately make sense to be added in production.
- We might have to generate the tests in the combinatorial testing from our schema in case more settings for spoilers are added in the future
- The data-flow testing (among others) will need excess optional debug logging to adequately verify the test results, which will require the system to send this only for testing - either through a "mode" or a parameter in requests
