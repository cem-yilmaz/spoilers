# Spoilers! for YouTube - Design Document

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to create a Chrome Extension and accompanying wiki that helps to prevent accidental exposure to spoilers on YouTube. The project is named "SPOILERS! for YouTube" and is intended to protect users from spoilers in the recommended videos section of YouTube and eventually other websites.

The project consists of two main components:

1. The Chrome Extension: This operates at the user end, blocking and warning about potential spoiler content on YouTube based on user preferences.

2. The Spoiler Wiki: A user-contributed platform where users can add media information and tag URLs with spoilers. It also supports a classification system where spoilers can be broken down into chapters, matches, episodes, parts, and sections of the media.

## Main Features

### 1. Chrome Extension

- **Content Blocking**: The extension should be able to block and warn about potential spoiler content in YouTube thumbnails based on user preferences. 
- **User Preferences**: Users should be able to search for a specific piece of media (e.g. a TV show, movie, or game) and set their spoiler sensitivity level (no media with details, no story beats, no major spoilers).
- **Spoiler Level Definition**: The extension should be able to adapt the level of spoiler prevention based on the user's progression through the media (e.g., unblocking spoilers for episodes already watched).

### 2. Spoiler Wiki

- **User Contributions**: Users can flag a URL for spoilers, describe what it spoils, and add media to a public database.
- **Media Information Management**: Media information is managed and maintained by volunteers. Media information can be broken down into smaller parts like chapters, matches, episodes, etc.
- **Non-linear Media Handling**: The wiki should accommodate non-linear media, e.g., video games or interactive narratives where the story is uncovered in a non-linear order.

## Implementation Details

### Chrome Extension

1. **Interaction with Content**: The extension will use JavaScript to interact with the web page DOM, altering the visibility and appearance of potentially spoiler-laden elements.
2. **Interaction with Database**: The extension will interface with the Spoiler Wiki's database using an API. The API will return relevant spoiler information based on the user's current media and spoiler sensitivity settings.

### Spoiler Wiki

1. **Database Structure**: The wiki will use a MongoDB database with two primary collections: `media` and `spoilers`. The `media` collection will hold media metadata (name, type, sections, etc.), and the `spoilers` collection will hold spoiler data (associated URL, media it spoils, section of media it spoils, etc.).
2. **Web Framework**: The wiki will be developed using the Node.js Express framework, with EJS as the templating language for server-side rendering.
3. **User Contributions**: User contribution features will be implemented with create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations. Users will be able to create new media entries, add/update spoiler information, and flag URLs as spoilers.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: The wiki will include user authentication and authorization features to manage access control and prevent spamming.

This design document provides a broad overview of the project's requirements, features, and implementation strategies. It is subject to change and refinement as the project progresses.

Please note that more detailed requirements gathering and system design are typically required for larger projects. Those may involve additional steps such as wireframing, system architecture design, database schema design, user experience (UX) design, and more in-depth planning for individual features. However, this simplified design document should provide a solid starting point.
