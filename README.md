# ⚠Spoilers!⚠

Spoilers! is an extension for Google Chrome that allows users to flag URL's (_in current scope, this is only YouTube videos_) for spoilers for certain media. Users can also add media they wish to consume, and the extension will block videos appearing with spoilers for this media. Media can be added to a public wiki that the extension uses to get it's spoilers from.

Spoilers! also supports spoilers being tagged on a per episode/chapter/level basis. Users can track how far through a piece of media they are if they want to retrospectively be shown spoiler-ridden media for stuff they've already consumed.

Spoilers! has 3 settings for sensitivity:
  - <b>No Spoilers</b> - Absolutely any and all URLs flagged with spoilers of any kind are blocked
  - <b>Plot details</b> - This is up for debate on a per media basis; for example, descriptions of characters may be allowed, but if they mention developments that would spoil the plot of episodes, this would be blocked.
  - <b>Major spoilers</b> - I imagine this is the most common option. Discussions of characters, setting, etc, are allowed, but major twists/reveals/events are blocked.
